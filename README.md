3. Activate it: `venv\Scripts\activate`

**Unix/macOS:**

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Create a virtual environment named `venv`: `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate`

**2. Install Dependencies:**

Once your virtual environment is active, install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
